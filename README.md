# Responsibilities for ETs

## Technical interviews

  One of the key responsibilities of an engineering trainer is to conduct technical interviews for future cohorts. This involves assessing candidates' aptitude and attitude by presenting them with challenges and asking questions. Engineering trainers also review interviews conducted by their colleagues and provide feedback on whether a candidate is a good fit for the course.

## Onboarding a cohort
  When a candidate is accepted into the program, the engineering trainer will onboard them by emailing them and collecting all the necessary information, such as usernames and emails. They will also invite the candidate to relevant applications such as Slack and GitHub, and ensure that they complete any required pre-work. During the pre-check-in appointment, the engineering trainer will assess the candidate's progress with the pre-work, check their equipment and environment setup, and answer any questions they may have.

  Normally, you would be onboarding a candidate at least 4 weeks before their start date. Unfortunately, sometimes this is not that case, if this ever happens, please adjust the timings on when the emails are sent to get the onboarding done in a timely manner.

## Supporting the SET and cohort

  As an Engineering Trainer, your main responsibility is supporting your SET with managing your cohort, onboarding them and getting them ready for their future placements. You are responsible for preparing teams, groups, and pairs for exercises, and for releasing project briefs and exercises using the `fp-cli`. 
  
  In addition, you will need to keep track of attendance and ensure that the cohort meets important administrative requirements, such as submitting CVs, headshots, and pull requests on time.
